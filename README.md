## 👋 About Me

Greetings! I’m **Sameeksha Dhakarwal**, a passionate and driven developer with a strong interest in **Machine Learning, Data Science, and Python-based application development**. I am deeply motivated by the challenge of transforming data into meaningful insights and building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

My journey in technology is rooted in a love for **problem-solving, logical thinking, and continuous learning**. With a solid foundation in **Python, data analysis, and machine learning**, I enjoy working on projects that involve predictive modeling, customer analytics, and decision-making systems. I have hands-on experience with tools and frameworks such as **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow**, and data visualization libraries, enabling me to develop end-to-end analytical and ML solutions.

I have also explored **classical machine learning, ensemble methods, neural networks, and hybrid intelligence models**, gaining practical exposure to building, evaluating, and optimizing models. This versatility allows me to approach problems from both an analytical and engineering perspective.

I am committed to **continuous growth and skill enhancement**, always eager to explore emerging technologies and modern methodologies in AI and software development. A collaborative learner by nature, I thrive in environments where knowledge-sharing and innovation drive impactful outcomes.

Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring new ideas, improving my problem-solving abilities, and challenging myself to think creatively. I believe every project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and make a meaningful contribution.
